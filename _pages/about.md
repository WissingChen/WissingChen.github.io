My research interests include causal inference 🎲and embodied intelligence🤖. I aim to explore the associations between various modalities of information from a causal perspective, thereby enhancing the robustness and reliability of intelligent system. I believe this approach can provide a strong foundation for embodied intelligence systems and medical image analysis, and facilitate the application of artificial intelligence in complex tasks. 

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the School of Computer Science at Sun Yat-sen University, under the supervision of Prof. [Lin Liang](http://www.linliang.net/) and Prof. [Liu Yang](https://yangliu9208.github.io/) in the [Human-Cyber-Physical Intelligence Integration (HCP-l2)](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/) Lab. In my spare time, I enjoy coding⌨, running🏃‍♂️, cycling🚴‍♂️, playing video games🎮, and cooking🥘.
